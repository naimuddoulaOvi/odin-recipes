    <p>
      These wings are always a hit! I grill them up before a party and keep them
      hot in a low oven. I always use Frank's RedHot® sauce. It's got lots of
      flavor and isn't too spicy.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>½ cup Italian-style salad dressing</li>
      <li>3 pounds chicken wings, cut apart at joints, wing tips discarded</li>
      <li>¼ cup butter</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>¼ cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®), or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine 1/2 cup soy sauce, Italian dressing, and chicken wings in a
        large, zip-top bag. Close bag and refrigerate 4 hours to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat. In a small saucepan, melt the
        butter. Stir in the 1 teaspoon soy sauce and the hot pepper sauce. Turn
        off heat and reserve.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the chicken wings from the marinade and pat dry. Cook the wings
        on the preheated grill, turning occasionally, until the chicken is well
        browned and no longer pink, 25 to 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place grilled wings in a large bowl. Pour butter sauce over wings; toss
        to mix well.
      </li>
    </ol>
